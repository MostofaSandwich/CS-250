#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs are based on what the user tells you then want out of a program. This also includes things that the programmer can ask the user about that are related to the things the user has explicitly said.
User stories are the easiest way to implement the user's needs into the agile workflow. They are what directs development and what the programmer bases their finishing conditions off of.

#How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I try to see what the over arching structure of the program will be. From there, I break it down into smaller bits that can be tested independantly and then bring them together as a final product.
There are many processes in agile that I want to implement into my own work in my career. Code reviews are huge, especially with more experienced peers. As are the daily stand ups and kanban.

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Confidently fitting into the team while being willing to adapt to whatever the needs of the team chang eto over time.
